The code you provided is the content of a Maven POM (Project Object Model) file named 'pom.xml'. 

This file is used to configure and manage the dependencies, plugins, and build settings for a Maven project. 

In this specific POM file, the project has a parent project with the artifactId 'final_task', groupId 'com.epam.dmytro_adamtsev', and version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'. 

The project itself has the artifactId 'neweracap'. 

The properties section defines various versions for different libraries and tools used in the project. 

The dependencies section lists the dependencies required by the project, including Serenity, Selenide, AssertJ, HTML Elements, TestNG, Lombok, and JSON. Each dependency is specified with its groupId, artifactId, and version. Some dependencies also have a scope defined, indicating whether they are required for compilation or only for testing. 

The build section includes a plugin configuration for the Maven Compiler Plugin, specifying the Java version to be used for compilation. In this case, the source and target versions are both set to 8.
