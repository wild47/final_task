1. Import the necessary page object class(es) into your test class.
2. Create an instance of the page object class.
3. Use the methods provided by the page object class to interact with the elements on the corresponding web page.

For example, if you want to interact with the elements on the home page of the web application, you would:

1. Import the `HomePage` class into your test class: `import pages.HomePage;`
2. Create an instance of the `HomePage` class: `HomePage homePage = new HomePage();`
3. Use the methods provided by the `HomePage` class to interact with the elements on the home page, such as clicking a button or entering data.

## Useful details
- Each page object class corresponds to a specific page of the web application.
- The page object classes are located in the `pages` folder.
- The methods provided by the page object classes are designed to represent common actions and interactions on each page.
- The page object classes may also include methods for verifying the content and state of the page.
- The page object classes are intended to be used in automated tests for the web application.
- By encapsulating the logic and actions related to each page in separate classes, the page object model makes the tests more readable, maintainable, and reusable.
