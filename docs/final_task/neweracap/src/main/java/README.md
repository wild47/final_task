## Overview
The `main/java` folder in the `neweracap` project contains the core Java code for the project. It includes subfolders and files that are essential for the functionality of the project.

## Usage
To use the code in this folder, you can import the necessary classes and instantiate them in your own code. The code in this folder serves as the backbone of the project and provides the necessary functionality for various features and components.

## Useful details
The `main/java` folder is organized into subfolders, each serving a specific purpose in the project. One of the subfolders is `pages`, which contains Java classes representing different pages of the website.

The `pages` folder is responsible for interacting with the elements on their respective pages. Each class in this folder corresponds to a specific page and provides methods to perform actions on that page.

To interact with a specific page, you can instantiate the corresponding class from the `pages` folder and call its methods to perform actions on the page. For example, to interact with the home page, you can instantiate the `HomePage` class and call its methods to perform actions on the home page.

Make sure to refer to the individual documentation files for each class in the `pages` folder for more detailed information on their purpose and usage.
