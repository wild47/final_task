## Overview
The `src` folder is a crucial component of the `neweracap` project. It contains the main code for the project and the test code and resources. The `src` folder is responsible for the functionality and testing of the project.

## Usage
To utilize the `src` folder in your project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `src/main` folder into your project's source code directory.
2. Copy the `src/test` folder into your project's source code directory.

Once the folders are copied, you can navigate through the subfolders and files to access the specific functionality or test code you need.

## Useful details
- The `src` folder consists of two main subfolders: `main` and `test`.
- The `main` folder contains the core code for the project. Each subfolder and file within `main` serves a specific purpose and can be utilized independently.
- The `test` folder contains the test code and resources for the project. It also consists of subfolders and files that are essential for configuring and running tests.
- It is important to note that the `src` folder is the central location for both the main code and test code, making it a crucial component of the project.
