## Usage
To utilize the `test` folder in your project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `src/test/java` folder into your project's source code directory.
2. Copy the `src/test/resources` folder into your project's resources directory.

## Useful details
- The `src/test/java` folder contains the test code for the NewEraCap project, including the `Configuration`, `JsonHelper`, and `NewEraCapTest` classes.
- The `src/test/resources` folder is used to store files that are essential for configuring and running tests in the software project. It contains the `suiteTest.xml` file, which is an XML file used to configure a TestNG test suite.
