## Useful details
- The `src/main` folder contains the main code for the project. This is where you will find the implementation of the project's functionality, such as the different pages and their corresponding classes.
- The `src/test` folder contains the test code and resources for the project. This is where you will find the test cases and any test-specific resources, such as test data or configuration files.
- It is important to note that the `src` folder should be copied to your project's source code directory, as it contains the core code and tests for the `neweracap` project.
