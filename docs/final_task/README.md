## Overview
The `final_task` folder contains the necessary files and folders for the project. It includes the `.idea` folder, which contains XML files for project configuration and settings, as well as the `neweracap` subfolder, which contains the main code and test code for the project.

## Usage
To use the `final_task` folder in your project, you can simply copy it to the desired location within your project's directory. The `.idea` folder is important for defining the project structure and behavior within your development environment, while the `neweracap` subfolder contains the implementation and test code for the project.

## Useful details
- The `.idea` folder contains XML files that are used for project configuration and settings. These files define the structure and behavior of the project within the development environment.
- The `neweracap` subfolder includes the main code and test code for the project. It is divided into `src/main` and `src/test` folders. 
- The `src/main` folder contains the implementation of the project's functionality, such as different pages and their corresponding classes.
- The `src/test` folder contains the test cases and any test-specific resources, such as test data or configuration files.
- It is important to note that the entire `src` folder should be copied to your project's directory, as it contains the main and test code for the project.
