# pom.xml
## Overview
The `pom.xml` file is an XML file used in Maven projects to define the project's configuration and dependencies. It plays a crucial role in a software project as it provides information about the project, its structure, and the dependencies required for building and running the project.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific prerequisites to use the `pom.xml` file itself. However, to work with a Maven project, you need to have Maven installed on your system.

## Usage
To use the `pom.xml` file in a project, follow these steps:
1. Create a new Maven project or navigate to an existing Maven project.
2. Locate the `pom.xml` file in the root directory of the project.
3. Open the `pom.xml` file in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).
4. Modify the contents of the `pom.xml` file as per your project requirements. This includes adding dependencies, configuring plugins, specifying build settings, etc.

## Useful details
The `pom.xml` file contains various elements that define the project's configuration. Here are some key elements present in the provided `pom.xml` file:

- `<groupId>`: Specifies the group or organization that the project belongs to.
- `<artifactId>`: Defines the unique identifier for the project.
- `<packaging>`: Specifies the type of artifact created by the project. In this case, it is set to `pom`, indicating that the project itself is a Maven module.
