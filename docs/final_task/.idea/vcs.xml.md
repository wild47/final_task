## Prerequisites
There are no specific dependencies or prerequisites required to use the `vcs.xml` file.

## Usage
To use the `vcs.xml` file in a software project, follow these steps:
1. Create a new file called `vcs.xml` in the project's directory.
2. Copy the code provided below into the `vcs.xml` file.
3. Modify the code to specify the desired VCS and directory mappings.
4. Save the `vcs.xml` file.

## Methods
The `vcs.xml` file does not contain any methods or functions. It is a configuration file written in XML format.

## Useful details
- The `<project>` tag is the root element of the XML file and specifies the version of the project.
- The `<component>` tag is used to define a component within the project.
- The `name` attribute of the `<component>` tag specifies the name of the component, which in this case is "VcsDirectoryMappings".
- The `<mapping>` tag is used to define a directory mapping for a specific VCS.
- The `directory` attribute of the `<mapping>` tag specifies the directory to be mapped. In the provided code, the directory is set to "$PROJECT_DIR$/..", which represents the project's directory.
- The `vcs` attribute of the `<mapping>` tag specifies the version control system to be used. In the provided code, the VCS is set to "Git".
